Translating Python for Everybody
================================

These course materials are Creative Commons Attribution and so they can be used
as long as they are attibuted properly.  I am happy to help those
adopting/adapting these materials make sure their acknowledgement is
sufficient.  I am always excited to learn of new translations and promote them
to my students.

All the material for this course (web site, autograders, PowerPoint, textbook, 
figures for the textbook, assignments, etc) is in this GitHub repository.  The
only material that is not in github are the videos and I can provide those as 
well if they need to be hosted behind a firewall or in a country that has banned 
YouTube.

You could also provide translations on the YouTube channel 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj7Bp8-DfGpfAfDBiblRfl5p

My ultimate goal would a series of complete web sites at urls like es.py4e.com, 
cn.py4e.com, ir.pye4.com with completely translated user experiences that also function
as OER repositories for Python materials in those languages.  Of course you do not
need to use my urls, but I do want to promote the translations of this material
and am happy to point my subdomains at your servers or forward requests at those
subdomains to your servers.

I have set this up so you can fork my github repository and begin the translation
work. I will be happy to help you get your translated work up and available.  I 
have an automatic build server for the text book that takes your latest book in 
github and produces the PDF and EPUB and hosts it online at 
http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/.

Do not feel the need to translate everything - many translations simply translate
the book.  Everything is helpful.

Thanks in advance
